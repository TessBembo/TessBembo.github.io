Dice are the emblem of statistics. With two of them, you have a 1-in-6 chance of rolling a seven. Anyone who’s played Catan knows: seven shows up vexatiously more often than that.

I found it maddening to be told, “Yes, but if you roll them 100 times…”

But why would I roll them 100 times? In real life, I only get one roll. I need statistics that can help me make sense of this roll — not some hypothetical average. That’s when I realized: I needed a different kind of statistics.

Classical models — like Rational Choice Theory — assume people make decisions like machines, optimizing cost-benefit calculations. That’s tidy. That’s mathematically convenient. But it’s wrong.

People don’t behave like rational calculators. We behave like Bayesian creatures, absorbing all the information we’ve seen, heard, or felt, then reacting accordingly — not always logically, but predictably.

This makes us astonishingly precise and deeply flawed. It’s how we survive. It’s also why we’re biased.

And that’s the point. If you’re trying to build a model that predicts real human behavior — in elections, finance, conflict, or even love — you can’t just rely on brute-force math. You have to understand the psychology of the person behind the data.

This blog is about that. It’s about the small, seemingly irrational quirks that power the biggest decisions we make — and how understanding them might make us better at building models that actually work.In a world obsessed with data, I believe the next frontier is not just more information — it’s better interpretation. That starts with understanding people.
