Like many people entering the world of quantitative finance and data science, I started with a fascination for numbers, patterns, and predictions. But unlike many, my academic path began in psychology—a field that explores the complexities of human behavior, decisions, and emotions.

At first glance, psychology and quantitative finance might seem worlds apart. One studies feelings and thoughts; the other crunches numbers. But the deeper I dive, the more I see how tightly these worlds are connected—especially when it comes to understanding risk, uncertainty, and market dynamics.

We often assume that financial markets are driven by rational actors and predictable models. But as any real-world event shows (from bubbles to crashes), humans are rarely fully rational. Biases, fears, overconfidence, and herd behavior play massive roles in financial outcomes. This is where psychology comes in—and where I believe the most robust models must account for both the **mathematical structure of risk** and the **messy realities of human behavior.**

I’m combining these two fields because I want to build models that do more than fit historical data; I want them to reflect how people actually behave under pressure, uncertainty, and shifting incentives. By bringing together psychological insight with mathematical rigor, I hope to contribute to more realistic, adaptable, and insightful tools in the world of finance.

This is the journey I’m documenting here—one step at a time, as I grow my expertise in both fields and work toward my long-term goal of becoming a quantitative analyst with a deep understanding of both people and numbers.
