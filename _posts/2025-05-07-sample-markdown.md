Welcome to my site! This is my first official post.

I created this space to document my journey into **data science**, and **behavioral modeling.** Over the next months, I’ll be sharing:

- **Projects** I'm working on (from predictive modeling to exploratory data analysis)
- **Certifications & skills** I’m building to strengthen my expertise
- **Thoughts & insights** about finance, math, and coding
- Progress toward my long-term goals in the finance and modeling world

I’ll also use this site to keep track of my learning milestones and reflect on what I’m building along the way.

If you're interested in connecting or collaborating, feel free to [reach out!](/contact)

Thanks for visiting—excited to share more soon!
