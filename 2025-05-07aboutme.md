Hi! I’m Tess Bembo, an aspiring <strong style="color:#e91e63;">quantitative analyst</strong> with a passion for modeling <strong style="color:#e91e63;">real—messy—human behavior</strong> in high-stakes environments like <strong style="color:#e91e63;">finance and risk management</strong>. I’m fascinated by how patterns can be used to predict outcomes and improve <strong style="color:#e91e63;">real-world decision-making</strong>.

I’m currently in my third year of a <strong style="color:#e91e63;">psychology degree at McGill University</strong>, with plans to pursue a <strong style="color:#e91e63;">second bachelor’s in mathematics</strong> starting in 2027.

Right now, I’m expanding my expertise through self-driven projects that combine my interests in <strong style="color:#e91e63;">mathematics, psychology, and finance</strong>—building a foundation to bridge <strong style="color:#e91e63;">human behavior and quantitative modeling</strong>, with a special focus on <strong style="color:#e91e63;">risk, uncertainty, and decision-making</strong>.

Outside of my academic and technical work, I’ve always gravitated toward challenges that test <strong style="color:#e91e63;">endurance, precision, and resilience</strong>. I was a <strong style="color:#e91e63;">national swimming champion in Panama</strong>, later competed in <strong style="color:#e91e63;">rugby</strong>, and today keep up my competitive edge through <strong style="color:#e91e63;">long-distance running</strong>—logging about 50 kilometers a week. Before transitioning into the world of models, I worked as a <strong style="color:#e91e63;">pastry chef</strong>, a craft that taught me <strong style="color:#e91e63;">patience, creativity, and discipline</strong>. I’m also passionate about giving back, and I <strong style="color:#e91e63;">volunteer regularly at a community center</strong> supporting underprivileged families.
