This journey began with a single article assigned in an otherwise innocuous course—<em>Psychological Tests</em>. For our final lecture, the professor (an incredible person to learn from) asked us to read <strong style="color:#e91e63;">Clinical Versus Actuarial Judgment</strong> by Dawes et al.

I’ve never been so impacted by a reading. It was logical, obvious even—and yet, psychology still resists the implementation of <strong style="color:#e91e63;">mathematically grounded judgment</strong>. That idea, <em>actuarial judgment</em>, grew like a pearl inside me, slow but persistent. Without realizing it, everything became a foundation for mathematics.

I started with SPSS, running basic stats just to learn how psychological research operates. But something was missing. <span style="color:#e91e63;"><em>Why</em> these tests? <em>Why</em> these assumptions?</span> And what happens if we violate them—do we simply risk falling into type I or II errors?

Around the same time, I learned about practices like <strong style="color:#e91e63;">p-hacking</strong> and <strong style="color:#e91e63;">HARKing</strong>—widespread behaviors that generate compelling yet meaningless results. I felt disillusioned. And that’s when I found <strong style="color:#e91e63;">quantitative psychology</strong>: a field striving for mathematical rigor in a sea of fuzzier logic.

But I didn’t just want to use the tools—I wanted to <strong style="color:#e91e63;">understand the theory</strong> behind them. That realization led me to plan for a second degree in <strong style="color:#e91e63;">mathematics</strong>, which I intend to pursue after completing my current studies in psychology. I aim to bridge two worlds: <strong style="color:#e91e63;">finance</strong> and <strong style="color:#e91e63;">psychology</strong>. Both fields rely on behavior, both are steeped in uncertainty—and both, I believe, can elevate each other through thoughtful modeling.

## <span style="color:#e91e63;">Why This Blog?</span>

This blog is where that mission lives.

Every project is an attempt to merge ideas across domains: applying financial simulations like <strong style="color:#e91e63;">Monte Carlo</strong> with behavioral twists, or reimagining psychological frameworks like <strong style="color:#e91e63;">Structural Equation Modeling</strong> through a quantitative finance lens.

This is my sandbox. My modeling bible. And the start of something bigger.
