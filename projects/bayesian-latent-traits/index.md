## <span style="color:#e91e63;">Bayesian Latent Trait Modeling in Financial Decision-Making</span>

This project explores how <strong style="color:#e91e63;">unobserved psychological traits</strong>—such as analytic thinking, risk sensitivity, and volatility aversion—can be modeled, simulated, and inferred within financial environments using <strong style="color:#e91e63;">Bayesian Structural Equation Modeling (BSEM)</strong>.

Traditional finance models often assume agent behavior is either rational or governed by simple rules. But in reality, investor decisions are influenced by <strong style="color:#e91e63;">latent psychological dispositions</strong> that aren’t directly observable. This project simulates and estimates these <strong style="color:#e91e63;">hidden traits</strong>, examining how they shape trading behavior and market outcomes.

## <span style="color:#e91e63;">How It Started</span>

This project had been on my mind for over six months. It began when I became fascinated with structural equation modeling through my psychology coursework. That led me down a rabbit hole of statistical frameworks, where I discovered <strong style="color:#e91e63;">Bayesian SEM</strong>—which sounded, frankly, like the coolest thing ever to a quant nerd like me.

My original plan was to use census data to predict mental wellbeing based on socioeconomic indicators. But those datasets—often binary—proved limiting for SEM’s statistical power. I also wanted to bring in a financial angle. After many sleepless nights revisiting models and methods, this project finally emerged.

## <span style="color:#e91e63;">Goals</span>

1. <strong style="color:#e91e63;">Simulate</strong> a population of agents with latent traits (e.g., holistic vs. analytic thinking).  
2. <strong style="color:#e91e63;">Define observable behaviors</strong>—like risk aversion or panic-selling—as <em>noisy reflections</em> of those traits.  
3. <strong style="color:#e91e63;">Construct a causal system</strong>: how traits influence mediators (e.g., volatility sensitivity), which in turn influence outcomes (e.g., profit/loss).  
4. <strong style="color:#e91e63;">Estimate the full model</strong> using Bayesian SEM and evaluate whether latent trait structures can be recovered from observed data.  
5. <strong style="color:#e91e63;">Explore generalization</strong>: Can we infer trader psychology from financial behavior alone?

## <span style="color:#e91e63;">Why BSEM?</span>

Using <strong style="color:#e91e63;">Bayesian structural modeling</strong> allows us to:

- Explicitly model <strong style="color:#e91e63;">uncertainty</strong> in both behavior and inference  
- Incorporate <strong style="color:#e91e63;">prior knowledge</strong> (e.g., that fear-prone agents are more reactive to loss)  
- Flexibly estimate <strong style="color:#e91e63;">latent-variable systems</strong>, even with limited or noisy data

This approach combines <strong style="color:#e91e63;">quantitative rigor</strong> with <strong style="color:#e91e63;">psychological insight</strong>, and offers a framework to model human-driven financial systems with greater psychological fidelity than black-box machine learning or traditional rational-agent simulations.

## <span style="color:#e91e63;">Why This Matters</span>

This project showcases how <strong style="color:#e91e63;">Bayesian modeling</strong> can be applied to <strong style="color:#e91e63;">psychological finance</strong>, and how <strong style="color:#e91e63;">latent cognition</strong> may be inferred from observable decisions. It also illustrates a broader vision: combining behavioral science with simulation to build interpretable, data-driven models of human systems.
